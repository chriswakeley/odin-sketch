# odin-sketch

An Etch-a-sketch-like drawing tool implemented using HTML/CSS/JS

Generates a grid of divs that update their color on mouseover events.  
By default, changes colors to black, but when "Rainbow" is toggled, updates colors on a continuous cycle through hues - this is implemented using a data attribute.   

When "Soft-brush" is toggled, the colors are either blended with a low alpha black, or low alpha rainbow color.
